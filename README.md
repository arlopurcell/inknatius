# Inknatius

A game built with the Godot engine, inspired by Hades, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (the Octopode race), and many others. 

You're an octopus who can put weapons and wands in each of your 8 arms, but you'll have to create them yourself. Clear the level and at the end you get supplies for forging. Try to go as deep as you can! Someday maybe there will be some more dungeon structure...
